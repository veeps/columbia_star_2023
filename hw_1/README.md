# Overview

We'll be working with a cereal dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/80-cereals). I have made some edits to it for the purposes of our workshops. The goal for this homework assignment is to get more comfortable with cleaning data, understanding data frame structure, and creating visuals for exploratory data analysis. We'll be building on the visuals you create in this homework assignment for next week's workshop session!
