## Overview
We will be building on the homework 1 assignment. We'll transform the visuals you created into an interactive dashboard. Between the second workshop and homework assignment, you'll be working towards creating [this dashboard on cereals!](https://veeps.shinyapps.io/shiny_workshop_23)

### Instructions
This will be a live coding session. I will share out the code throughout the session to help follow along. At the end of the session, I will send out a file with the final code from the session. That way, even if you are a little lost in the sesion, you will still have the final product.
